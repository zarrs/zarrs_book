## `zarrs` - A Rust Library for the Zarr Storage Format

`zarrs` is a Rust library for the Zarr V2 and Zarr V3 array storage formats.
If you don't know what Zarr is, check out:
- the official Zarr website: [zarr.dev](https://zarr.dev), and
- the [Zarr V3 specification](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v3/core/v3.0.html).

`zarrs` was originally designed exclusively as a Rust library for Zarr V3.
However, it now supports a V3 compatible subset of Zarr V2, and has Python and C/C++ bindings.

This book focuses mostly on the Rust implementation.

## Using `zarrs` with `zarr-python`

[![zarr-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/zarr--developers/zarr--python-GitHub-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python) is the reference Python Zarr implementation.

The `zarrs` Python bindings [![zarr-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/ilan--gold/zarrs--python-GitHub-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/ilan-gold/zarrs-python) expose a high-performance codec pipeline to `zarr-python` that uses `zarrs` under the hood.
There is no need to learn a new API and it is supported by downstream libraries like `dask`.

> [!TIP]
> Skip to the [Python Bindings Chapter](./zarrs_python.md) if you are not interested in the Rust library.

## ðŸš€ `zarrs` is Fast

The [![zarr_benchmarks](https://img.shields.io/badge/zarrs/zarr__benchmarks-GitHub-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/zarrs/zarr_benchmarks) repository includes benchmarks of `zarrs` against other Zarr V3 implementations.
Check out the benchmarks below that measure the time to round trip a \\(1024x2048x2048\\) `uint16` array encoded in various ways:
